Subject: Minor bug fixes.

- G38.x was not printing correctly in the $G g-code state reports. Now
fixed.

- Potential bug regarding volatile variables inside a struct. It has
never been a problem in v0.9, but ran into this during v1.0
development. Just to be safe, the fixes are applied here.

- Updated pre-built firmwares with these two bug fixes.
